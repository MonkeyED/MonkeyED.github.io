			<p>MonkeyED was created to deliver <b>100% FREE</b> content but we also need money to run our servers and to create better content for all of our users. We would <i>GREATLY</i> appreciate it if you could donate a couple of spare bucks to us and keep our services running!</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, we still haven't implemented this feature but it will be created in the future.</p>
