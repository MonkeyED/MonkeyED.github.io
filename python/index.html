      <div class="panel">
        <p>When you compare Python to any other programming language, say C++ for example, you will notice numerous similarities. For one, Python is much easier to read and it is actually very possible for someone who has no programming experience to understand Python code to some level. Python was originally built for simplicity after all. It also already has pre-defined functions like <big><code style="background-color: #eee;"><span style="color:#8250DF;">input</span></code></big> where as many other languages including C, C++, C#, etc. will have many functions that you will need to create yourself.</p>
