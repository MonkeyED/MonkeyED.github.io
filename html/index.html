			<p>HTML is a simple language that you can use to create all different sorts of cool websites! It's actually not a Programming Langauage, it's a Scripting Language. A Markup Language is a code language that creates something. It annotates a document, or creates designs, and it won't really "run".</p>
			<p>HTML is all over the web! All websites you see are made with HTML, <a style="text-decoration:underline !important;color:black;" href="/css">CSS</a>, and <a style="text-decoration:underline !important;color:black;" href="/javascript">JavaScript</a>. Only using HTML won't make your websites look good so you'll want to learn CSS and JS after HTML!</p>
			<p>Since HTML is all over the web, you will only need a web browser to see your HTML websites. Simply open up your file in your browser and you'll be able to see the website!</p>
